NPRonAndroid
============

Incomplete Android app that accesses NPR articles through their API

This app only displays the headline, teaser, and date of the first 20 Science articles from the NPR API.
For this app to work, an API key for NPR must be added MainActivity.java

This is an incomplete implementation and crashes when an individual article is tapped.

This project is built directly on top of the code presented by Ravi Tamada in the post Android JSON Parsing Tutorial:
( http://www.androidhive.info/2012/01/android-json-parsing-tutorial/ )
and by Sourav Das ( titan7585 ) on the project CMSoops:
